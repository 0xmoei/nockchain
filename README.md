## Nockchain
Nockchain uses ZK-Proof of Work as its consensus mechanism for providing trustless settlement and ordering guarantees. ZK-Proof of Work is similar to Hashing-Proof of Work in that miners compete to try to run a puzzle computation repeatedly with different nonces until the hash of the output is less than a targeted number, colloquially referred to as the difficulty. In our initial implementation of ZK-Proof of Work, miners create a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) of a fixed puzzle computation and then hash the ZKP.

## $NOCK Details
- Total Supply: 2^32 nocks (around 4.29 billion).
- 100% of $NOCK is issued by the Nockchain ZKPoW consensus protocol to miners.
- $NOCK is used to pay for blockspace on Nockchain.


## Mainnet Details
- Mainnet to be launched at 19th May.
- For Testnet, we run *"Miner"* and a *"simulated local testnet"* with a **fake genesis block**, to connect our Miner to it.
- Once Mainnet live, **public peers** are published, so we just need to run Miner alone. It connects to public peers.

## $NOCK Issuance Details
- The **earlier** you start mining, the **BIGGER** rewards you are going to earn.
