## Nockchain
Nockchain is a lightweight chain for heavyweight compute. It uses ZK-Proof of Work (zkPoW). Miners create a ZK-Proof (ZKP) of a fixed puzzle computation, then hash the ZKP, and earn $NOCK based on their computation power.

## $NOCK Details
- Total Supply: 2^32 nocks (around 4.29 billion).
- Fair launch: 100% of $NOCK will be issued to Miners.
- $NOCK is used to pay for blockspace on Nockchain.


## Mainnet Details
- Mainnet to be launched at 19th May.
- For Testnet, we run *"Miner"* and a *"simulated local testnet"* with a **fake genesis block**, to connect our Miner to it.
- Once Mainnet live, **public peers** are published, so we just need to run Miner alone. It connects to public peers.

## $NOCK Issuance Details
- The **earlier** you start mining, the **BIGGER** rewards you are going to earn.
